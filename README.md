This repository contains data and code to reproduce analysis and figures in the above manuscript.
The path for sequencing data is `data/raw` and has been deposited in GenBank under BioProject PRJNA765018, Sequence Read Archive with accessions SRA21540851-SRA21540891, and assigned to BioSamples SAMN21540851-SAMN21540891. ASVs were deposited in the nucleotide database with accession KFLF00000000. The *phyloseq* object used for analysis containing all data is [here](data/intermediate/ps_t_noRep.rds).

We use metabarcoding of a region from the 16S gene to study the prokaryotic diversity in salt marshes from Southern Spain, across the ecological succession, seasons and in rhizospheric soil from halophytes respect to adjacent bulk soil. We find the most influential factor structuring bacterial assemblages is stage in the succession, followed by season and rhizosphere. Microbial ecology from salt marshes offer a promising field in ecological research to evaluate well-stablished ecological theories historically developed in plant systems.
